Venam updater
=================

******
NEEDS TO GET UPDATED AS I DON'T USE HOTMAIL ANYMORE
-------
I'll merge the new stuff later when I have time and want to backup.

This is some modules with a front-end
to show status I want to follow

[*] How to use

    Change the configs in the updater.py
    
    Change the config file

    #Add the updater.py in your bin dir

    create a small .sh script to start everything as a daemon:

        killall python2;

        python2 /location/of/pythondaemon.py /location/of/updater.py;
